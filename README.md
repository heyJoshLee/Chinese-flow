# Chinese FLow

A fullstack Javascript app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and Redux for helping language learners study Chinese.
Currently, there is no live version. If you want to use it yourself, you will need to set up a local MERN dev enviroment.

## How it Works

This app has reading resources for Chinese learners. It automatically extracts unique vocabulary in each resource and compares the vocabulary to the known vocbulary in a user's vocbulary bank. The user can add new words from a resource and practice studying them using flash cards.

The purpose of this app is to use comprehensible input in order to provide users with resources that are neither too hard nor too easy for them.

## Todo

- fix redux update state when adding and removing cards
- SRS algo
- Fix Heroku integration
